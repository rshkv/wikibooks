<h1 id="abstract">Hanlon's razor</h1>
<p><b>Hanlon's razor</b> is an <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aphorism#content">aphorism</a> expressed in
    various ways including "Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity,"<sup><a
            href="article.html#cite_note-Wigosky-2004-1">[1]</a></sup><sup><a href="article.html#cite_note-wikiquote-2">[2]</a></sup>
    or "Don't assume bad intentions over neglect and misunderstanding." It recommends a way of eliminating unlikely
    explanations for a phenomenon (a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razor_(philosophy)">philosophical
        razor</a>).
</p>
<p>As an eponymous law, it may have been named after a Robert J. Hanlon. There
    are also earlier sayings that convey the same idea dating back at least as far
    as Goethe in 1774.</p>

<h2 id="Origins_and_etymology">Origins and etymology</h2>
<p>Inspired by Occam's razor, the aphorism was popularized in this form and
    under this name by the Jargon File, a glossary of computer programmer
    slang. In 1990, it appeared in the Jargon File described as a "'murphyism'
    parallel to Occam's Razor." Later that same year, the Jargon File editors
    noted lack of knowledge about the term's derivation and the existence of a
    similar epigram by William James. In 1996, the Jargon File entry on Hanlon's
    Razor noted the existence of a similar quotation in Robert A. Heinlein's short
    story "Logic of Empire" (1941), with speculation that Hanlon's Razor might be
    a corruption of "Heinlein's Razor." (A character in Heinlein's story
    described the "devil theory" fallacy, explaining, "You have attributed
    conditions to villainy that simply result from stupidity.")</p>

<p>In 2001, Quentin Stafford-Fraser published two blog entries citing e-mails
    from one Joseph E. Bigler about how the quotation originally came from Robert
    J. Hanlon of Scranton, Pennsylvania, as a submission for a book compilation of
    various jokes related to Murphy's law published in Arthur Bloch's Murphy's Law
    Book Two: More Reasons Why Things Go Wrong! (1980). Subsequently, in 2002,
    the Jargon File entry noted the same, though not definitively.</p>

<h2 id="Similar_quotations">Similar quotations</h2>
<p>Another similar quotation appears in Goethe's The Sorrows of Young Werther
    (1774):</p>

<blockquote>...misunderstandings and neglect create more confusion in this world
    than
    trickery and malice. At any rate, the last two are certainly much less
    frequent.
</blockquote>

<p>Similarly, Jane West's The Loyalists (1812) includes:</p>

<blockquote>Let us not attribute to malice and cruelty what may be referred to less criminal
    motives. Do we not often afflict others undesignedly, and, from mere
    carelessness, neglect to relieve distress?
</blockquote>

<p>A common (and more laconic) British English variation, coined by Bernard
    Ingham,
    is the saying "cock-up before conspiracy," deriving from this 1985
    quotation:</p>

<blockquote>Many journalists have fallen for the conspiracy theory of government. I do
    assure you that they would produce more accurate work if they adhered to the
    cock-up theory.
</blockquote>

<p>Another similar instance from politics is the attribution by First Minister
    of
    Scotland, Henry McLeish, of financial irregularities that led to his
    resignation
    in 2001, to "a muddle not a fiddle."</p>

<p>"Heinlein's Razor" has since been defined as variations on "Never attribute
    to
    malice that which can be adequately explained by stupidity, but don't rule out
    malice." This quotation is falsely attributed to Albert Einstein in Peter W.
    Singer's book Wired for War (2009).</p>

<p>An homage to Hanlon's razor with the form of Arthur C. Clarke's third law
    argues
    the distinction is moot:</p>

<blockquote>Any sufficiently advanced cluelessness is indistinguishable from
    malice.
</blockquote>
